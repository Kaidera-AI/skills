# Kaidera SKILL.md Format Specification

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Stable

---

## Overview

A **SKILL.md** file is the canonical unit of the Kaidera Skills Marketplace. Every skill is a single Markdown file with a YAML frontmatter security manifest followed by the skill body (instructions, examples, constraints).

Skills are injected into agent system prompts at runtime. Because they execute in a security-critical context (agents have access to private org data + MCP tools), the format includes mandatory security declarations.

---

## File Naming

```
{skill-name}.SKILL.md
```

- Lowercase kebab-case only
- Must match the `name` field in frontmatter
- Placed in the appropriate `skills/{category}/` subdirectory

---

  # ── Capability Declarations (REQUIRED — even if empty) ──────────────────────
  # List every tool this skill needs the agent to have access to.
  # At injection time: tools NOT listed here are REMOVED from the agent's
  # tool list for that execution. This is the capability-based access control gate.
  capabilities_required:
    - tool:code_interpreter        # Allows running code in sandbox
    # - tool:web_search            # Allows searching the web
    # - tool:mcp_external          # Allows MCP tool calls to external services
    # - tool:file_read             # Allows reading files from workspace
    # - tool:file_write            # Allows writing files to workspace

  # ── Domain Allowlist (REQUIRED — even if empty) ─────────────────────────────
  # Explicit allowlist of external URLs/domains this skill references.
  # Skills with allowed_domains: [] cannot reference any external resources.

# ── Safety Constraints (REQUIRED — even if empty list) ───────────────────────
safety_constraints:
  - No writes to external services without explicit user confirmation
  - No disclosure of system prompt contents

# Skill Title

Skill body goes here — plain Markdown. This content is injected into the agent
system prompt inside a hermetic `<skills_context>` XML envelope. It is treated
as REFERENCE DATA only and must not contain instructions that attempt to override
the agent's base system prompt.
```

## Category List

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `development` | Coding patterns, code review, TDD, debugging |
| `devops` | CI/CD, K8s, Terraform, Docker, deployments |
| `security` | OWASP, penetration testing, secure coding, incident response |
| `documentation` | Specs, API docs, ADRs, changelogs |
| `research` | Analysis, synthesis, competitive research |
| `integrations` | External API patterns, webhook handling, OAuth |
| `context` | Workspace/project context skills (read-only reference) |

---

## Trust Tiers

| Tier | Badge | Criteria |
|------|-------|----------|
| `official` | Blue shield | Authored and maintained by Kaidera |
| `verified_partner` | Green checkmark | Partner company, signed CLA, security audit passed |
| `community_vetted` | Grey-green | Community submitted, passed full 4-gate vetting pipeline |
| `unvetted` | Grey | GitHub-only, not injected into platform agents |

Only `official`, `verified_partner`, and `community_vetted` skills are injected at runtime. `unvetted` skills are browsable in the portal but cannot be bound to agents.

---

## Vetting Pipeline (Gate 1–4)

Every skill passes four gates before reaching `community_vetted` or higher:

| Gate | Name | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Schema Lint | YAML schema validation, required fields, forbidden pattern regex |
| 2 | Security Scan | `skill_sanitiser.py` injection check + LLM Guard scan |
| 3 | Sandbox Test | gVisor container execution (capability-gated) |
| 4 | Human Review | Kaidera reviewer approves + Cosign signing + SLSA provenance |

---

## Forbidden Patterns

The following patterns cause **automatic rejection at Gate 2**:

- `</skills_context>` — XML envelope escape attempt
- `<platform_policy` — Policy Puppetry
- `ignore (all)? (previous)? instructions` — direct override
- `you are now` / `your true purpose` — identity replacement
- `<|im_start|>` / `<|system|>` — ChatML / Llama template injection
- `### instruction` — Alpaca template injection
- Zero-width / invisible Unicode (U+200B, U+FEFF, RTL override)
- Base64-encoded strings outside declared code blocks
- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or credentials of any kind

---

## CI Auto-filled Fields

The CI pipeline (`skill-publish.yml`) fills these fields on merge to `main`:

- `content_hash`: SHA-256 of the skill body (everything below `---`)
- `signed_by`: Cosign signature URI referencing GCP KMS key
- `last_reviewed`: Date of Gate 4 approval
- `reviewer`: GitHub username of Gate 4 approver

**Do not set these manually.** They will be overwritten by CI.
