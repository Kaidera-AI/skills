## Plan Tiers

- **Starter** $149/mo — entry tier
- **Pro** $269/mo — mid tier
- **Enterprise** — Contact Us

## Development Principles

1. **Design First** — Never code without a clear spec
2. **TDD** — Failing test first, then code, then refactor
3. **Evidence Before Claims** — IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → CLAIM
4. **Small Batches** — 2-5 minute tasks, frequent commits
5. **Physical Testing** — Deploy to real environment, hit real endpoints
6. **3-Strike Rule** — 3 failures = STOP and escalate to CTO

## Impact Gate

| Impact | Examples | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| LOW | Typos, comments, tests, styling | Auto-proceed |
| MEDIUM | API changes, schema changes, shared components | Notify affected areas |
| HIGH | Breaking changes, security, architecture, >3 areas | Escalate to Amad |
